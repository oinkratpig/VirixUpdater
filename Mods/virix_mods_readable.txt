==============================
 RESOURCE PACKS
==============================

Load order:
(Descending - 1 is loaded last)
(Same order as it should be in the resouce packs screen)
(1) Virix
	Just replaced basic textures for the main menu.
(2) PickupSound
	Only contains the pickup sound from Parallax Sounds.
	https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/parallax-sounds
	All audio in this resource pack is stereo, meaning it does not work as intended.
	The pickup sound is too good to do without, though.
(3) Omori Music Replacement
	https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/omori-music-pack
	Like Parallax Sounds, all audio was mono.
	There was a small enough amount of audio that converting was reasonable.
(4) Enhanced Audio
	https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/enhanced-audio
(5) Skyrim Soundpack
	https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/soundpack-skyrim-175/
	Iconic Skyrim sounds take away from immersion so this is loaded before Enhanced Audio.
	Some of the sounds are so amazing though it's worth occasional immersion breaks.
(6) JICKLUS
	https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/jicklus

==============================
 SHADERS
==============================

Insanity Shader
	https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/insanity-shader
	I think fog / moody atmosphere is gorgeous.
